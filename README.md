# Open-Diesel-pre-alpha
This is a project idea for Maritime and Facility Engineers at the California Maritime Academy

The goal with this project is to ease stress for engineering students enrolled in simulator classes.

GOALS: 
  1. Open source in the sense of free to use AND free to modify (manipulate systems to match other or custom plants) 
  2. Avialable to use anywhere without restriction. 
    a. Current conditions require limit the use of simulators on specific computers with the programs installed, this limits the useablitly of the programs
  3. Creating realistic scenarios
